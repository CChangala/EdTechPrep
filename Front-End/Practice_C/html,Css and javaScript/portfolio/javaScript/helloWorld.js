//variables:
var val = 2 + 2;
//
let num = 2 + 2;
console.log(num,typeof num);
//we can have infinity(x/0) and aswell as bigInt in js. and to avoid the confusion we are allowed to use _ in multiples of 10.
console.log(val);
//typecasting:
let num2 = String(6);
console.log(num2);
//or
let num3 = (6).toString();
console.log(num3);
//tofixed() - returns string to a decimal point mentioned.
let num4 = (10.256787).toFixed(2);
console.log(num4);
//there is concept called coercion : come to concensus before perfomring operation. when is + it takes string and, - as integers.
//any number is taken as boolean true
