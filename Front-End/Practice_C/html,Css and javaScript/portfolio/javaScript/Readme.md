- js is a intrepred programming laguage that is primarily used for client-side web development  but can also be used on the server-side node.js or react and also machine learning because of the javascript engine.
- node.js is a runtime env/engine that has javascript engine which runs javascript.
- js evaluates from left to right. 5 + 4 + "hello" = "9hello".
-  JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can execute only one task at a time in a single call stack. However, it uses asynchronous operations like callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle multiple tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread.
# variables:
- we can have infinity(x/0) and aswell as bigInt in js. and to avoid the confusion we are allowed to use _ in multiples of 10.
# typecasting:
- there is concept called coercion : come to concensus before perfomring operation. when is + it takes string and, - as integers.
- any number is taken as boolean true
# Scopes in Js:
- ## Block Scope: 
    - Can only be used with in block. can only use let and var
- ## Global Scope:
    - Variables declared outside function and block have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the script.
- ## Function Scope:
    - Can only be use in function.
# declaring variables:
- var is function-scoped or globally-scoped, not block-scoped.
    - hoisted but not initialize.
- let is block-scoped
- const is block-scoped
# Object - look in 06- objects.
